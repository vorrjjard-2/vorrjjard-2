## 🔭 Current Focus
- **Computer Vision** — Implementing YOLO architectures end-to-end in PyTorch, including dataloaders, augmentation pipelines, anchor logic, and detection heads.  
- **Deep Learning Foundations** — Studying and applying CNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, and feature engineering techniques.  
- **Research Preparation** — Weekly ML/CV paper reading and Zettelkasten note-taking.  
- **System Crafting** — Building a productive Arch Linux + Hyprland workflow.

## 📂 Projects
- **YOLO Family** — I build YOLO object detectors from scratch to solve a variety of real-world problems.
- **Fundamentals** — In my free time, I explore no-library implementations of classic ML concepts to build intuition on the math behind the algorithms
- **Rest Coming Soon!**
