# Ruben Saulog

Hello! I’m a machine learning engineer & enthusiast, hoping to leverage the power of iterative learning to push humanity forward. Feel free to reach me through my contact details below if you want to collaborate on an ML project, discuss AI trends, or just have a coffee in general :)

## 🔭 Current Focus
- **Computer Vision** : Implementing YOLO architectures end-to-end in PyTorch, including dataloaders, augmentation pipelines, anchor logic, and detection heads.
- **Sales Forecasting** : Using different models to predict sales to optimize inventory usage (my current job!) 
---

## 📂 Projects
- **YOLO Playground** — I built a way to easily test different backbones, necks, heads, hyperparameters, and datasets on YOLO style models! Check out the repo on my profile.  
- **Fundamentals** — In my free time, I explore no-library implementations of classic ML concepts to build intuition on the math behind the algorithms.
- **Rest Coming Soon!**
